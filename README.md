# Repo Lab

A sandbox repository for experiments, prototypes, and future product ideas. It is a transparent lab where I explore new technologies, test assumptions, and iterate on early concepts before they evolve into full-fledged products.

## Why Repo Lab?
Building innovative products requires constant experimentation and learning. Repo Lab serves as a playground to:
- Validate ideas quickly without overhead.
- Share prototypes openly with collaborators.
- Document early design decisions and research.
- Keep track of lessons learned during R&D.

## Structure
This repository is organized into directories for different types of artifacts:
- **/notes/** – Markdown documents capturing brainstorming sessions, research summaries, and technical notes.
- **/prototypes/** – Small proof-of-concept apps, scripts, or UI demos.
- **/snippets/** – Reusable code snippets, helper functions, and reference patterns.
- **/ideas/** – Future product ideas, features, or modules to explore.

## Tech Stack
Since this is a lab, there is no single tech stack. Expect to see experiments using:
- Node.js and TypeScript for backend prototypes.
- React/Next.js for frontend components.
- Supabase and PostgreSQL for quick data storage.
- Python notebooks for data analysis and AI exploration.
- Docker and GitHub Actions for testing and CI/CD experiments.

## Planned Features
- Maintain a changelog documenting experiments and lessons learned.
- Add GitHub issue templates for new experiment proposals.
- Set up a wiki section for extensive documentation.
- Integrate automated code quality checks and linters.
